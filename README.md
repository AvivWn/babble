# Babble Labble
A system for generating training labels via natural language explanations

[UNDER CONSTRUCTION]

This repo will contain code demonstrating the framework described in:

Braden Hancock, Paroma Varma, Stephanie Wang, Martin Bringmann, Percy Liang, Chris RÃ©, Training Classifiers with Natural Language Explanations, ACL18.

We are currently developing a series of tutorials to demonstrate the Babble Labble pipeline, let you experiment with writing your own explanations, and explore various design tradeoffs. The code will be released soon after ACL 2018 (mid to late August). You can be notified of the release by watching this repository.
